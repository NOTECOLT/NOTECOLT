## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Diego! I'm a Game Developer, but I also do music stuff on the side. I have also dabbled in some pixel art.

Check my other socials if you wanna see my non game-related work! An alumni of the Philippine-based student game dev org DevelUP.

Here, on my GitHub, you'll find all the spaghetti code for my games on [itch.io](https://notecolt.itch.io/). I hope you enjoy <3
